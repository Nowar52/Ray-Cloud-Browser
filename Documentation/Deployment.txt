For the infrastructure, you can use the cloud.

The setup for our demo is a t1.micro spot instance with a 64 GiB EBS 
volume attached to the instance. A typical bacterial genome will require
around 600 MiB of space for the graph and paths (in binary format).

1. Run Ray with -write-kmers on your data
2. Clone de Ray-Cloud-Browser git repository on your server
3. Go in server/ and type "make"
4. Convert kmers.txt to kmers.dat with RayCloudBrowser.createGraphDatabase
5. Convert Contigs.fasta to Contigs.dat with RayCloudBrowser.createPathDatabase
6. Edit server/config.json
7. Deploy /server using a webserver (see examples in Documentation/)
8. Point your browser to http://server/client
