This is a short guide to get started using Ray Cloud Browser.
If you feel something that is missing or that could be improved,
please fill a issue on github.

You can easily deploy Ray Cloud Browser in any GNU/Linux distribution on your desktop.

If you want others to access your data, you can use the cloud. It's easy, secure, and cheap.
See Cloud.txt for details.

To view a sample in Ray Cloud Browser, you need:

* a map file (kmers.txt -- the kmer graph file generated by Ray);
* a section file (usually Contigs.fasta)

You can also throw any section you want (like contigs from another assembler, genes you like,
and so on).


Steps required to use your own Ray Cloud Browser are below.

First, we need to install the software.


1. Install a web server (like lighttpd)

2. Create $HOME/Ray-Cloud-Browser-instance/

3. Clone the Ray-Cloud-Browser git repository on your computer, in $HOME/Ray-Cloud-Browser-instance/

4. Go in $HOME/Ray-Cloud-Browser-instance/Ray-Cloud-Browser/server/ and type "make", this will build 
RayCloudBrowser.cgi (the web service) and RayCloudBrowser-client (the tool to manage the instance)

5. Copy config.json-EXAMPLE to config.json (also in server/)

6. Deploy Ray Cloud Browser with your web server.
   => See server/web-server-configuration/README

7. Point your web browser to http://localhost/client

8. Run Ray with -write-kmers on your DNA reads to generate kmers.txt and Contigs.fasta
put these in $HOME/Ray-Cloud-Browser-instance/Ray-Cloud-Browser/server/data/Sample-Name

9. Convert kmers.txt to kmers.dat with RayCloudBrowser-client create-map

10. Convert Contigs.fasta to Contigs.dat with RayCloudBrowser-client create-section

11. Add the map file (kmers.dat) with RayCloudBrowser-client add-map

12. Add the section file (Contigs.dat) with RayCloudBrowser-client add-section

13. Annotate the map with the section using RayCloudBrowser-client create-map-annotations-with-section

14. Point your web browser to http://localhost/client ;

	You should be able to select your location.
