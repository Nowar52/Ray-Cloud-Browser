This is a short guide to get started using Ray Cloud Browser.


For the infrastructure, you can use the cloud. It's easy, secure, and cheap.

The setup for our demo is a t1.micro spot instance with a 64 GiB EBS 
volume attached to the instance. A typical bacterial genome will require
around 600 MiB of space for the graph and paths (in binary format).

t1.micro spot instances are really cheap: 0.0030 $ per hour on average.
We have a 64 GiB volume because we are hosting many samples. You probably need
something smaller.

Steps
-------

1. Run Ray with -write-kmers on your data
2. Clone de Ray-Cloud-Browser git repository on your server
3. Go in server/ and type "make"
4. Convert kmers.txt to kmers.dat with RayCloudBrowser-client create-map
5. Convert Contigs.fasta to Contigs.dat with RayCloudBrowser-client create-section
6. Edit server/config.json
7. Deploy /server using a webserver (see examples in Documentation/)
8. Point your browser to http://address.com/client


If that does not work, check your web server log, in general this is

/var/log/httpd/error_log
