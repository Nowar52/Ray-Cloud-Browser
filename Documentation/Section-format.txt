A section is basically just a indexed fasta file.

A section contains regions and locations can be viewed for regions.


<magicNumber>
<numberOfRegions>
<nameStart><nameLength><sequenceStart><sequenceLength>
<nameStart><nameLength><sequenceStart><sequenceLength>
<nameStart><nameLength><sequenceStart><sequenceLength>
<nameData><sequenceData>
<nameData><sequenceData>
<nameData><sequenceData>


With this format, we are able to obtain a k-mer at any location of the
form (region,location) in constant time.
