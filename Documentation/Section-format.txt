ASCII version:

A section is basically just a fasta file.
A section contains regions and locations can be viewed for regions.


binary version:

<uint32_t magicNumber>
<uint32_t format>
<uint64_t numberOfRegions>
<uint64_t nameStart><uint64_t nameLength><uint64_t sequenceStart><uint64_t sequenceLength>
<uint64_t nameStart><uint64_t nameLength><uint64_t sequenceStart><uint64_t sequenceLength>
<uint64_t nameStart><uint64_t nameLength><uint64_t sequenceStart><uint64_t sequenceLength>
...
<uint8_t nameData[]><uint8_t sequenceData[]>
<uint8_t nameData[]><uint8_t sequenceData[]>
<uint8_t nameData[]><uint8_t sequenceData[]>
...


Regions are sorted by length in descending order.

With this format, we are able to obtain a k-mer at any location of the
form (region,location) in constant time.
