## Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS)

Ray Cloud Browser can be deployed on AWS using Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2).

The setup for our demo is a t1.micro spot instance with a 64 GiB EBS 
volume attached to the instance. A typical bacterial genome will require
around 600 MiB of space for the graph and paths (in binary format).

t1.micro spot instances are really cheap: 0.0030 $ per hour on average.
We have a 64 GiB volume because we are hosting many samples. You probably need
something smaller.

## IBM SmartCloud

This platform is quite stable.

## Rackspace

This platform is quite stable.

## Windows Azure

We did some tests on a Linux Virtual Machine in Windows Azure, but it rebooted several times
without our intervention and the virtual block device disappeared at some point (?).
